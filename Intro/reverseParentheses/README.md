You have a string `s` that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. It is guaranteed that the parentheses in `s` form a regular bracket sequence.

Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. The results string should not contain any parentheses.

__Example__

For string s = "`a(bc)de`", the output should be <br />
`reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde"`.
